# Video Noise Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing noise in video files to identify patterns, enhance video quality, and provide insights into noise characteristics. It employs Python libraries such as OpenCV, Numpy, and Matplotlib to process video frames and perform noise-related computations.

## Features
- **Video Frame Extraction**: Efficiently extracts frames from video files using OpenCV.
- **Noise Analysis**: Computes noise statistics to identify and quantify noise in video frames.
- **Visualizations**: Generates plots to visualize noise patterns across frames.
- **Extensibility**: Provides a framework that can be extended for video denoising or other related tasks.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Pip package manager

### Required Libraries
Install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
### Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Video_Noise_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load a video, extract frames, and analyze noise.

### Key Functions
- **`extract_frames(video_path)`**: Extracts frames from the provided video file.
- **`compute_noise(frame)`**: Analyzes noise in a single frame.
- **`plot_noise_statistics(noise_data)`**: Visualizes noise patterns over frames.

## Example
1. Place your video file in the `data/` directory.
2. Update the `video_path` variable in the notebook to point to your video file.
3. Run the notebook cells to analyze and visualize the video noise.
